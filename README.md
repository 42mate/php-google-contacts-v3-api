# php-google-contacts-v3-api
PHP library for the Google Contacts API (v3)

## Setup

1. Fill in the `clientID`, `clientSecret` and `redirectUri` in `config.json`.
  * Note that `redirectUri` should be configure to point towards the `redirect-handler.php` file.
  * The `clientID` and `clientSecret` can be found in the Google Developers console at https://console.developers.google.com/ under 'APIs & auth' -> 'Credentials'.

2. Go to `authorise-application.php` in a web browser. This should give you a URL to authorise your application for Google Contacts.
3. Go to the authorisation URL provided by the previous tep.
4. Accept the permissions requested on the page displayed. You should then be redirected back to the `redirect-handler.php` file.
5. The page generated by the `redirect-handler.php` file should then present you with a refresh token. Copy this into your `config.json`.
6. Setup is done!
